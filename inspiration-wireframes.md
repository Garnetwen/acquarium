i want to create a **playground** like website
a website that evolves over time: the weather will change throughout the day.
instead of a garden, it is an acquarium.

different for each use: everyday, user can open a drift bottle contain different items.
My inspiration is from 
1. animal restaurant
2. acqurarium 

3. a deserted dock, where the user can collect fishs and put into their aquarium.
   Potential features
4. in their aquarium, they can collect fish and customize their aquarium(background color, sand color, wood).
5. share their acquarium screenshot
6. 

7. Aesthetic: 1. main page: David Hockney scrabble game photography 2. drift bottle: ASCII 3. zine-like 
8.
