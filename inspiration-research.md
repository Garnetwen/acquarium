i want to create a **playground** like website
a website that evolves over time: the weather will change throughout the day.
instead of a garden, it is an acquarium.
each user will have different fishs coming out from water.

different for each use: everyday, user can open a drift bottle contain different items.
My inspiration is from 
1. animal restaurant
2. **acqurarium ratings** from Bilibili [ I learnt most of the knowledge from there]
3. **DREDGE** a game on steam (I love it!)
.÷/
Purpose of this game: **trying to avoid problems occured in acquarium**

![problems](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/201d127d-a896-4f71-b126-073d63cdc022)

In my website, I will only focus on Sea sections. 
The four main problem: 

**Design Problem**:

   1.lighting (often use weird lighting blue/other cannot see fish)

   2.background: using weird design background( too noisy and garish)
   
   3.decorations: mismatch the vibe/boring/use plastic plants instead of real ones
   
   4. Not presenting a authentic environment that resemable the real geography feature(wrong plants)
      
   5. **it is just not pretty**
   6. mixing a bunch of fishs together: mismatch the vibe/fish fight and hurt themselves)


   
 **Fish itself**:
   1. use captive breading instead of wild animal (unless acquarium bread themselves/rescue)
  
 
 
 
 **Nametag**:
 1. use incoherent nametag/wrong name (Latin name here and Vernacular name in other places）
 2. simply wikipedia/wrong fish picture posted
 3. outdated knowledge (Shark)
 **ethics**:
 1. use human injection color fish
 2. Tank too small for fish (fish will grow, if remain in a small space it will wear their skins/have health problems)
 3. animal performance: unreasonable performing time/frequency, mermaid performance(mixing with dangerous species/ bad water quality), sea lion/ dolphins performance (lifting human, or draging boat )



Wireframes: 
 a deserted dock, where the user can go fishing and put into their aquarium.
   Potential features
 in their aquarium, they can collect fish and souvenirs. 
 they can customize their aquarium(background color, sand color, wood).
 share their acquarium screenshot
